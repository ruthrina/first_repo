# Create a recursive function

# Create an inner function to calculate the addition in the following way
# Create an outer function that will accept two parameters, a and b
# Create an inner function inside an outer function that will calculate the addition of a and b
# At last, an outer function will add 5 into addition and return it
# Write a program to create function func1() to accept a variable length of arguments and print their value.

# Write a program to create function calculation() such that it can accept two variables and calculate addition and subtraction. Also, it must return both addition and subtraction in a single return call.

# Write a program to create a function show_employee() using the following conditions.
# It should accept the employee’s name and salary and display both.
# If the salary is missing in the function call then assign default value 9000 to salary


# Find the largest item from a given list
# x = [4, 6, 8, 24, 12, 2]

# Generate a Python list of all the even numbers between 4 to 30

# Assign a different name to function and call it through the new name

# Create a function with default argumentWrite a program to create a function show_employee() using the following conditions.
# It should accept the employee’s name and salary and display both.
# If the salary is missing in the function call then assign default value 9000 to salary

# Return multiple values from a function
# Write a program to create function calculation() such that it can accept two variables and calculate addition and subtraction. Also, it must return both addition and subtraction in a single return call.
